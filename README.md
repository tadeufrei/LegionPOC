# LegionPOC

**LegionPOC** is a proof-of-concept system built using the [Flower](https://flower.dev) federated learning framework. It focuses on secure, privacy-preserving collaborative learning across distributed clients, particularly in the context of **cybersecurity for critical infrastructure**.

LegionPOC integrates:
- **Federated Learning (FL)** using Flower and PyTorch
- **Sample-level Differential Privacy (DP)** with Opacus
- **Binary-encoded CAN bus datasets** for intrusion detection
- **Client-specific data preprocessing** and test partitioning
- **Custom evaluation metrics and threat modeling**

## ðŸ“¦ Key Features

- âœ… Flower-based FL client/server architecture
- âœ… Opacus privacy engine with adjustable Îµ/Î´ and gradient clipping
- âœ… Binary conversion of CAN ID, payload, and metadata
- âœ… Fine-grained, label-balanced data partitioning across clients
- âœ… Client-local training and evaluation using accuracy, F1, recall
